# Python Maze Simulation

Python Maze Simulation is an application that uses the TKinter library to simulate maze navigation using Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* search. This application also generates a unique maze. This data can be saved from within the application to a csv file for further analysis.
